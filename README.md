📡 PHILOSOPHY

> “The state fears the coder more than the soldier.”



- Privacy is not paranoia, it’s survival.  
- Censorship breeds curiosity.  
- Freedom cannot be granted, only taken.  
- Trust in code, not in governments.  
- Knowledge shared is a weapon multiplied.

🌐 OPEN SOURCE OR DIE

> Proprietary systems are prisons with shiny walls.
The true hacker builds tools that empower, not enslave.
